 Intent
 
 Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, 
 and create new objects by copying this prototype.
 
 Co-opt one instance of a class for use as a breeder of all future instances.
 
 The new operator considered harmful.

/// This is base on this tutorial:
/// https://medium.com/jeremy-codes/prototype-pattern-in-swift-1b50517d1075
/// The explanation or reason for Prototype pattern is:
/// If you think carefully this pattern is applied every time you use value types
/// in Swift (Arrays, Int, Bool, etc), because every time you assign the value
/// of an instance to another one a new copy is made with the same values.
/// The problem is with reference values (classes) that every time you assign
/// an instance to a new one both share its values and modifications to they.
