/**
 
 Intent
 
 Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than 
 one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and 
 pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
 
 Launch-and-leave requests with a single processing pipeline that contains 
 many possible handlers.
 
 An object-oriented linked list with recursive traversal.
 
 Avoid coupling the sender of a request to the receiver by giving more than
 one object a chance to handle the request
 
 Would I Use This Pattern?
 
 This pattern is recommended when either of the following scenarios 
 occur in your application:
 
 Multiple objects can handle a request and the handler doesn't 
 have to be a specific object
 
 A set of objects should be able to handle a request with the handler 
 determined at runtime
 
 A request not being handled is an acceptable outcome.
